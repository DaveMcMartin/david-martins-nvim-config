# David's NVIM config

This is my [nvim](https://neovim.io/) config that I use for codding.

## How to install

You need a true color terminal, I use iTerm2, choose one of your preference. Also, install a [Nerd Font](https://www.nerdfonts.com/) and configure it as the font of your terminal. You also need to install [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep), [node](https://nodejs.org/en).

After that, just clone this repository like this:

```bash
mkdir ~/.config/nvim && git@github.com:DaveMcMartin/david-martins-nvim-config.git ~/.config/nvim
```

That is it, next time you open nvim everything will automatically installed for you.
